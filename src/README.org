
The primary source code for StrangeAttractorZoo.

Only one file here is probably of interest to most people:

  -[[https://github.com/richmit/StrangeAttractorZoo/blob/main/src/README.org][zoo.json]] ::
    This JSON file has the definitions for all the strange
    attractors.  Equations, initial conditions, step sizes, curve
    lengths, etc...

The rest of the code here is very much dependent up on a pretty
complex software stack and some details of my personal system
configuration.

I hope to write up a "how to build" document at some point.
