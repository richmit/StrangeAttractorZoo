

The home of Mitch's Strange Attractor Zoo!

The zoo is here https://richmit.github.io/StrangeAttractorZoo/

If you are interested in writing your own code, then you can find
things like attractor formulas, initial values, and integration ranges
in this JSON file:

https://github.com/richmit/StrangeAttractorZoo/blob/main/src/zoo.json

The build system to create the web page is in the
[[https://github.com/richmit/StrangeAttractorZoo/tree/main/src][src/]]
folder, but I have to warn you it is probably difficult to get working
outside of my environment.  Still I wrote up
[[https://richmit.github.io/StrangeAttractorZoo/dev.html][some notes]]
on that if you really want to try.

Lastly there are a few [[https://github.com/richmit/StrangeAttractorZoo/tree/main/maple][Maple worksheets]] for various attractors.
