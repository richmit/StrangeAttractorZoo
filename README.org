

The home of Mitch's Strange Attractor Zoo!

The zoo is here https://richmit.github.io/StrangeAttractorZoo/

If you are interested in writing your own code, then you can find
things like attractor formulas, initial values, and integration ranges
in the
[[https://github.com/richmit/StrangeAttractorZoo/blob/main/src/zoo.json][zoo.json]]
file.

If you would like to play with curve data, you can find simple CSV files in the
[[https://github.com/richmit/StrangeAttractorZoo/tree/main/CSVs][CSVs/]] directory.

If you would like to explore the curves with a VTK capable viewer,
then you can find VTU files in the
[[https://github.com/richmit/StrangeAttractorZoo/tree/main/VTUs][VTUs/]]
directory.  That directory also contains a ParaView Python file for
each VTU file.  Simply run ParaView with the python file as it's only
argument, and ParaView should load up the VTU file and set the view
properly.

The build system to create the web page is in the
[[https://github.com/richmit/StrangeAttractorZoo/tree/main/src][src/]]
folder, but I have to warn you it is probably difficult to get working
outside of my environment.  Still I wrote up
[[https://richmit.github.io/StrangeAttractorZoo/dev.html][some notes]]
on that if you really want to try.

Lastly there are a few [[https://github.com/richmit/StrangeAttractorZoo/tree/main/maple][Maple worksheets]] for various attractors.
